<p>This is was my favorite book, although the movie is no where close to the movie it was still a good stand alone movie.</p>
<h3>Hercules</h3>
<p>Probable nostalgia, but this movie was one of my favorites growing up.</p>
<h3>Polar Express</h3>
<p>Watched this movie literally 100 times, so good.</p>
